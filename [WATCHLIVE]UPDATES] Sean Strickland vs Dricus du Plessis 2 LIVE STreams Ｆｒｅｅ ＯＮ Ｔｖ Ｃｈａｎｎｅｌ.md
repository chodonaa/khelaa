UFC makes a rare visit down under on Saturday, with Dricus Du Plessis putting his middleweight title on the line against Sean Strickland as the headlining act for UFC 312 in Sydney, Australia.

The main act marks the second meeting between the two fighters after South African star Du Plessis claimed the title from California's Strickland with a split decision in January of 2024.

Having made a successful first defense of his belt against Israel Adesanya at UFC 305 in August, Du Plessis now takes on Strickland again at the top of a bill that also sees women's strawweight belt holder Zhang Weili attempt to defend her title against Tatiana Suarez.

How to watch UFC 312 in the US
The UFC has a long-running partnership with ESPN. That's great news for the UFC and the expansion of the sport of MMA, but it's bad news for the consumer choice of US UFC fans.

In the US, if you want to watch UFC 312, you'll find the fight night only on pay-per-view through ESPN Plus. The cost structure is a bit confusing, but here are the options to watch UFC on ESPN, according to ESPN's site:

Existing annual ESPN Plus subscribers can order the upcoming UFC card for $80.
New ESPN Plus subscribers can buy a bundle of the UFC 312 PPV event (streaming in HD) and an ESPN Plus annual recurring subscription for $135. This is a decent deal. The ESPN Plus annual ESPN subscription will auto-renew after one year, at the price of an ESPN Plus annual subscription at the time of auto-renewal.

How to watch UFC 312 online from anywhere using a VPN
If you find yourself unable to view UFC 312 locally due to incorrectly applied blackout restrictions, you may need a different way to watch the bout and that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on fight night by encrypting your traffic, plus it's a great idea for when you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.
